## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript form validation
- CSS Josh Comeau custom reset
- SASS precompiler

### What I learned

Form validation is by far the hardest part of these challenges. I try to make it impossible to digit anything that could make totals give an error
This challenge made me work a lot on the JS code, although i think i wrote too much and there's something i'm missing about input validation

### Continued development

I will work more on form validation to increase the reliability of the results
